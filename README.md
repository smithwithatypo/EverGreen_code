# Code from my research lab
The goal of this code was to automate how we keep equilibrium for a large aquarium (20+ large Tilapia) to be used in a aquaponic system. <br><br><br>


I used Raspberry Pi's to process input data from sensors and output commands to intervention systems (like water chillers when the water temperature read too hot)
